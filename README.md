First, run the development server:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ./ --typescript --tailwind --eslint
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? … No / Yes

npx shadcn-ui@latest init
✔ Which style would you like to use? › Default
✔ Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
✔ Would you like to use CSS variables for colors? … no / yes

npx shadcn-ui@latest init


```
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
